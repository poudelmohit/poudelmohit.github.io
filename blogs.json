For instance, Sequence alignment of protein gives an overview of how unchanged the particular region of protein is during the evolutionary process.</p>\n<p>Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) may refer to the process of sequence alignment of three or more biological sequences which are mostly, assumed to have shared evolutionary relationships.<br>Multiple sequence alignments can be used to visualize conserved sequences in order to infer sequence homology or to perform phylogenetic analysis.</p>\n<p>Out of different file formats, the Clustal format is used mostly for sequence alignment tasks. The CLUSTAL format includes a plain-text key to annotate conserved columns of the alignment, denoting conserved sequence (*), conservative mutations (:), semi-conservative mutations (.), and non-conservative mutations (\u00a0)</p>\n<p>Different softwares have been developed for multiple sequence alignment purposes, such as SAM, Opal, MUSCLE,\u00a0etc.</p>\n<h4>Today, we are going to use MUSCLE for multiple-sequence alignment</h4>\n<p>MUltiple Sequence Comparison by Log-Expectation (MUSCLE) is computer software for multiple sequence alignment of protein and nucleotide sequences.</p>\n<p>To download and install MUSCLE, please refer to this youtube video from Bioinformatics Coach\u00a0:</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/162a40d0913a984c84ec7d06e6017ebc/href\">https://medium.com/media/162a40d0913a984c84ec7d06e6017ebc/href</a><p>In order to perform multiple sequence alignment, we actually need sequences to align.

SAM files can be analysed and edited with the software <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAMtools\">SAMtools</a>.</p>\n<p>The header section must be prior to the alignment section if it is present. Headings begin with the \u2018@\u2019 symbol, which distinguishes them from the alignment section. Below header, Alignment sections are present with 11 mandatory fields, as well as a variable number of optional\u00a0fields.</p>\n<p>Mandatory fields and their meaning\u00a0are:</p>\n<p>QNAME\u00a0: Query name where * means not available</p>\n<p>FLAG\u00a0: combination of bit-wise flags to denote multiple attributes of read\u00a0sequence</p>\n<p>RNAME\u00a0: Name of reference sequence generally chromosome number</p>\n<p>POS\u00a0: 1-based leftmost mapping POSition of the first matching\u00a0base</p>\n<p>MAPQ\u00a0: Mapping Quality where 255 means \u2018not available\u2019</p>\n<p>CIGAR\u00a0: Strings to describe alignment</p>\n<p>RNEXT\u00a0: Reference name of next\u00a0read</p>\n<p>PNEXT\u00a0: position of next\u00a0read</p>\n<p>TLEN\u00a0: Observed template\u00a0length</p>\n<p>SEQ\u00a0: Segment\u00a0Sequence</p>\n<p>QUAL\u00a0: ASCII of Phreds-scale based quality plus\u00a033</p>\n<p>See more about SAM file formats from here: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAM_(file_format)\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAM_(file_format)</a></p>\n<p>4. BAM</p>\n<p>BAM standing for Binary Alignment Map, is compressed binary version of a SAM file that is used to represent aligned sequences.</p>\n<p>BAM files contain a header section and an alignment section:</p>\n<p>\u25b6<strong>Header</strong>\u200a\u2014\u200aContains information about the entire file, such as sample name, sample length, and alignment method. Alignments in the alignments section are associated with specific information in the header section.<br>\u25b6<strong>Alignments</strong>\u200a\u2014\u200aContains read name, read sequence, read quality, alignment information, and custom tags. The read name includes the chromosome, start coordinate, alignment quality, and the match descriptor string.</p>\n<p>5. VCF</p>\n<p><strong>VCF is the standard file format </strong>for storing variation data. It is used by large scale variant mapping projects such as <a href=\"http://www.internationalgenome.org/\">IGSR</a>. It is also the standard output of variant calling software such as <a href=\"https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/\">GATK</a> and the standard input for variant analysis tools such as the <a href=\"http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/index.html\">VEP</a> or for variation archives like\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/eva/\">EVA</a>.</p>\n<p>VCF is a preferred format because it is <strong>unambiguous, scalable and flexible</strong>, allowing extra information to be added to the info field. Many millions of variants can be stored in a single VCF\u00a0file.</p>\n<p>There are some other file formats such as\u00a0.gff,\u00a0.gff2,\u00a0.gvf,\u00a0.maf,\u00a0.tsv and many\u00a0more.</p>\n<p>In Day2 of the 7 days series, we will be exploring another concept( of which I have no idea yet). Let the journey\u00a0begin...</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=3ac2feea3a0e\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n","enclosure":{},"categories":["bioinformatics","self-learn","genomics"]}]}
